          * Place the **Star Cluster Board** in the center of the table. Use
            either side, but the "dead end" side is *not* recommended for your
            1st game.
          * Flip the **Dice Board** to the correct side based on player count
          * Place the **Median Marker** near the dice board
          * Set out the appropriate number of dice based on player count
            * **4 players:**  9 dice
            * **2/3 players:** 7 dice
          * Turn the **Planetary System Tiles** face down, mix them up and
            distribute 16 of them to to the planetary system locations on the
            star cluster board.
          * Place the **Gyrodyne Board** anywhere against the star cluster
            board
            * Separate the **Gyrodyne Tiles** by type and stack each group
              in its place on the gyrodyne board
            * Make 3 stacks of the **Construction Award Tiles** with the
              7 point award on top.  Place these in their spaces on the
              gyrodyne board
          * Place the **Die Modifiers Board** anywhere against the star
            cluster board.
            * Give each player a *+/-* modifier token.  Stack the rest in
              their spaces on the board.
            * Put the *+/- 2* modifier tokens on the board.
          * Shuffle the **Exploration Bonus Tiles** and put them in a face
            down stack near the board.
          * Randomly choose 3 of the **Goal Tiles** and place them against
            the star cluster board.
          * Randomly choose 3 **Technology Boards** such that you have a
            *I*, a *II*, and a *III*.  e.g. *AI*, *DII*, *CIII*.  Place these
            against the star cluster board with the *I* on the inside and the
            *III* on the outside.
            * Set the **Time Marker** pointing to the innermost row of the
              technologies.
          * Set the **Engineering Cubes** near the board.
          * Place the **4 Cube Tokens** near the engineering cubes.
          * Group the **Transmitter Tiles** according to their letters (*A*,
            *B*, and *C*).  Stack each group letter side up and shuffle.  Then,
            make one stack with the *C*s on the bottom, *B*s in the middle,
            and *A*s on top.  Lay out the top 3 transmitters near the stack.
          * Each player takes the following:
            * 2 **Rocket Figures** (3 are used in a 2 player game)
            * 6 **Pulsar Claim Rings**
            * 1 **100 Point Tile**
            * 1 **+/- Die Modifier Token** (you should have handed these out
              in an above step)
            * 1 **HQ Board** Pass these out at random.  The player can choose
              which side to use.
            * Player tokens in the player color
          * Each player places one of their rockets on the play order spaces
            in random order.  (Based on this play order, do the following)
            * Each player places a token on both the engineering track and
              the initiative track with the 1st player on the bottom and
              the last player on top.
            * Each player places a token on the score track with the 1st
              player on the 5 point slot.  In player order, place each other
              players token 1 higher on the score track.  e.g. in a 4 player
              game, the player going last will start with 8 points.
            * Beginning with the last player and proceeding in reverse order,
              each player places a rocket on an unoccupied entry gate.
